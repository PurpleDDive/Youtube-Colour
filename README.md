# Youtube Colour
A new css remodel of the overall look of Youtube through userstyles (stylus addon) to add better-looking subtitles and more colour to your videos. It now works with the newest UI.

***Although this was originally intended to be used in dark mode, recent updates will focus more on light mode aesthetics and bug fixes.***
